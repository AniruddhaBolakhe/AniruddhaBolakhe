## About
I’m Aniruddha Bolakhe, an AI engineer with a background in Computer Science (IoT and Intelligent Systems). I work on architecting and deploying production-grade AI systems that combine deep learning, generative models, and retrieval-augmented frameworks. My approach emphasizes scalability, deterministic data flows, and rigorous engineering practices—core principles for building reliable modern AI infrastructure.

I specialize in:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and optimized embedding pipelines
- Vector search systems using Qdrant, Pinecone, and ChromaDB
- Deep learning models for vision and sequence tasks using TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Backend engineering with FastAPI and high-throughput data processing pipelines
- Asynchronous automation ecosystems using Redis, TaskIQ, Celery, and RabbitMQ

My work is driven by an interest in designing AI systems that operate reliably under real-world constraints. I focus on unifying advanced modeling techniques with robust engineering fundamentals to create solutions that scale effectively and deliver measurable impact.
