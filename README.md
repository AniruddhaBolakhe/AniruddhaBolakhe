## About
I’m Aniruddha Bolakhe, an AI engineer with a background in Computer Science (IoT and Intelligent Systems). I design and deploy production-grade AI systems that integrate deep learning, generative AI, and retrieval-augmented architectures. My work emphasizes scalability, and structured data workflows—key requirements for modern AI engineering.

I specialize in:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and high-performance embedding pipelines  
- Vector search architectures using Qdrant, Pinecone, ChromaDB  
- Deep learning systems for vision and sequence modeling (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- Backend engineering with FastAPI and scalable data processing stacks  
- Asynchronous automation pipelines built with Redis, TaskIQ, Celery, and RabbitMQ  

My core interest lies in building AI systems that are reliable, efficient, and deployable in real-world environments. I aim to bridge advanced model design with strong engineering fundamentals to deliver AI solutions that scale and create measurable impact.
